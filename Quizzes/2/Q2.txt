1A) The closest programming language to machine code is Fortran.
1B) It needs a compiler, but it is not use an interpreter to use lines.
2A) The oldest high-level programming language still in use is Fortran.
2B) C was developed in the 1950s.
3A) Fortran is a second-generation language.
3B) Third-Generation
4) 1970s, 1980s, 1990s
5) An ancestor to C is Jolt.
6) An ancestor to C++ is Python.
7) An ancestor of MATLAB is Python.
8) c = cell(2,2)
    c{1,1} = [1 3 -7; 2 0 6; 0 5 1]
    c{2,1} = [3 + 4*i, -5; -10*i, 3-4*i]
    c{1,2} = ['This is a text string']
    c{2,2}
9) c{2}
ans =
   3.0000 + 4.0000i  -5.0000 + 0.0000i
   0.0000 -10.0000i   3.0000 - 4.0000i
You get this value because you have defined a direction, i, so all the values must
have that constant plus the i direction.
10) MATLAB follows column-wise data storage. It means the first value is in the top
left corner then the values are in order down the first column. Then MATLAB goes to
the second column after storing the values in the first column.
11) int64 is 64 bits of information, and each byte is 8 bits; therefore,
int64 contains 8 bytes of information.
12) If you store a number outside the range of int32, MATLAB will change the
number to the largest (or smallest) value it can hold. This is number coersion.
